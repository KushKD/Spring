Primary Functions of Spring Containers:
 Create and Manage Objects (Inversion of Control)
 Inject Objects Dependencies (Dependency  Injection)
 
Configuring Spring Containers
XML Configuration File (Legacy, but most legacy apps still use this)
Java Annotations (Modern)
Java Source Code (Modren)


Spring Development Process
Configure your Spring Beans
Create a Spring Container
Retrieve spring Beans From Spring Container

Step I;
Configure Your Spring Beans  ApplicationContext.xml
<beans>
	<bean id="myCoach"
		  class="com.kushkumardhawan.springdemo.BaseballCoach"   </bean>   //fully qualified name of class
</beans>

Step II:
Create a Spring Container
Spring Container is generally known as application context
Specialized Implementations: 
								ClassPathXMLApplicationContext
								AnnotationConfigApplicationContext
								GenericWebApplicationContext
		ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("ApplicationContext.xml");


Step III:
Retrieve Bean From a Container
//Create a Spring Container
ClassPathXmlApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("ApplicationContext.xml");
//Retrieve an Object
Coach theCoach = context.getBean("myCoach",Coach.class);  i.e. beanId , Interface Name

SPRING BEAN

A "Spring Bean" is simply a Java object.

When Java objects are created by the Spring Container, then Spring refers to them as "Spring Beans".

Spring Beans are created from normal Java classes .... just like Java objects.
