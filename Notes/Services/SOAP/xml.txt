XML == Extensible Markup language
Allows us to make our own mark up language

Adventages
Custom Markup like <orderid>
It carries both the data and the mata data
We can provide Validation Rules
XML can be used as an Configuration file
Save the data, Manupilate the Data and Present the data


XSD
Is the Grammer and Blueprint for the XML Document
	Elements
	Attributes
	Namespace
	Order
	Number of Occurences
	Restrictions
	
XML Follows XSD isValid
XSD has a 	.xsd Extention
	
E.g
We can ave am ORDER.xml and ORDER.XSD

NameSpaces
Uniquly Identify the XML Components
targetNamespace

Prefix: xmlns:amnz="http://amazon.com/ordrs>

XML SCHEMA USE CASE


WHEN TO USE A SOAP WEB SERVICE:
Form Contract is Required  ---- WSDL

SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) Current Version of Soap is 1.2
 <soap:Envolop>  root element
  	<soap:header>  used to send the meta element
  		<soap:body>  main body
  				<creditcard></creditcard>
  				
 Faliure Message
  <soap:fault>
  	<soap:code>  errro was on te client side or service side
  	 <soap:reason> 
  	    <soap:text> Card Expired> </soap:text>
  	    
  	    
  	    
  	    
WSDL : Web Services Desription Language Also, Contract Betwwn the Provider and Consumer
What this Web service Provises and how it provides it

defination
		types
		messaes  
		operations
		porttype
		binding

Which WSDL to USe



Two Approches to Develop SOAP Services
Top Down  WSDL and Contract First
	Generate the JAVA stubs using tools like wsdl2java
	Iplement the Webservice EndPoint

Bottom up  Code First Approach



JAX WS
Specification  CXF,glassFish
API  Annotations and Developers Set of Annotations

@javax.jws.WebService  == Mark Class or Interface as Endpoint
@javax.jws.WebMethod,WebParam  ==  Mark Web Method as EndPoint
@javax.xml.ws.WebFault  == Creating Custom Annotations
@javax.xml.Soap.SoapBinding


JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) Version 2.2  org.jvnet
Allows to Deal with XML with Less Complexicty
  XJC TOOL converts the XML Schema to Java Classes
  SCHEMGEN TOOL Converts XML Schema from JAVA Classes 
  These two tools works at compile time
  In Runtime


XML Schem to JAXB Classes

		Create the Project
		Create the Schema Files
		Use the JAXB Plugin
		Use the Plugin to genetrate the stubs to serialise and deserialise
